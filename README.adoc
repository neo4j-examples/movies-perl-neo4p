== Neo4j Movies Demo App in perl with neo4p

=== Stack

* Neo4j-Server
* Mojolicious, the Perl real-time web framework
* REST::Neo4p, the Perl binding to Neo4j-Server
* Try::Tiny
* JSON

=== Setup

First get yourself setup with link:http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/[perlbrew] so we don't break any other Perl stuff you have on your machine. After you've got that installed let's setup an environment for our app:

[source]
----
(neo4p-movies)$ curl -kL http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew init
(neo4p-movies)$ echo ”export PATH=$PATH:/home/<USER>/perl5/perlbrew/bin" > /home/<USER>/.bashrc
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew mirror    # Pick a preferred CPAN mirror
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew available    # See what is available
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew install perl-5.21.7    # Install some Perls, e.g., Perl version 5.21.7 or any other version
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew list     # See what was installed
(neo4p-movies)$ perlbrew switch perl-5.21.7 && perl -v    # Swith to an installation and set it as default
----

The next step is to install the dependencies for the app:

[source]
----
(neo4p-movies)$ perl Build.PL
(neo4p-movies)$ make
(neo4p-movies)$ sudo make install
----

=== Run locally

Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser]. Then install the Movies data-set with `:play movies`, click the statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

And finally let's start up a Mojolicious web server:

[source]
----
(neo4p-movies)$ perl movie_neo4p
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000/
----

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the Neo4j application
